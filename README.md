# Navimacs

The simpliest WebExtension that introduces Emacs-like navigation keystrokes for all web-pages. Tested with Chrome 61 and Firefox 57.

Published in both stores:

* [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/navimacs/cmelogdihgljddfhenofpeodinceofbh)
* [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/navimacs/)

The keystrokes supported so far:

```
C-p - scroll step up
C-n - scroll step down
C-f - scroll step right
C-b - scroll step left
M-< - scroll to top
M-> - scroll to bottom
```

Scrolling step is dynamic and depends on the height/width of the current window. It's supposed to scroll the size of the visible document aread in 5 steps.
